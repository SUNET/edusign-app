"""
Client for the Signature Service Integration REST-Service [1].
==============================================================

The service has 2 sides: a REST API, and a sign service.

In what follows we will call "service" to both the REST API and the signature
service, "client" to our backend service that sends requests to the API, and
"user" or "browser" to the user agent that sends requests to our backend
service and is eventually directed to the signature service.

To use the service, it is necessary to have Basic Auth credentials for a
profile policy in the service.

There are 4 basic steps to complete a signature procedure:

+ The client sends a document to the API to be prepared for signature.

+ The client sends a request to the API to create and obtain a signature
  request for one or more previously prepared documents.

+ The user POSTs the signature request obtained in the previous step to the
  signature service, and is taken to an IdP where they provide credentials to
  sign the document(s). This will end in the user POSTing a form with a sign
  response to a callback in the client.

+ The client grabs the sign response provided by the service to the user and
  POSTed by the user to the client, and uses it to retrieve the signed
  documents from the API.

          found, the entityID of the IdP chosen by the user. Note that the client (the flask app)
          will try to identify the user via seamlessaccess.org, and it will record the IdP chosen by

        It will include references to all the already prepared documents that

        The main pieces of data we have to send to this endpoint are:

          will be redirected after completing the signature process at the sign service.

        + authnRequirements.authnServiceID: entityID of the IdP that will perform the authentication
          for signature.

        + authnRequirements.authnContextClassRefs: The AuthnContextClassRef URI(s) that we request
          that the user is authenticated under.

        + authnRequirements.requestedSignerAttributes: A list of SAML attributes and values.
          It is necessary to provide values for all atributes previously sent as signerAttributes
          to the `prepare` endpoint.

        + tbsDocuments: A list in which each item carries metadata about one the documents to be signed.
          The metadata is as follows:

        + tbsDocuments.N.id: A unique identifier for the document issued by the client.

        + tbsDocuments.N.contentReference: This value was in the response from the API to the call
          to the `prepare` endpoint, as `updatedPdfDocumentReference`.

        + tbsDocuments.N.mimeType: application/pdf

        + tbsDocuments.N.visiblePdfSignatureRequirement: This was also in the response from the API
          to the call to the `prepare` endpoint.
